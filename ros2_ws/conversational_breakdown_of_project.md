Here’s a simple, conversational breakdown of the project so you can confidently demo it.

## Project Overview

We built a ROS package that makes a simulated robot:

1. **Find the nearest wall**.
2. **Follow that wall** while keeping a fixed distance.
3. **Record its odometry** (where it’s been and how far it’s traveled).

Everything runs in a Gazebo simulation with a TurtleBot3.

## Folder Structure (colloquial version)

```
ros_wall_following/
├── srv/FindWall.srv          # A custom service to trigger the 'find wall' behavior
├── action/OdomRecord.action  # A custom action to record odometry data over time
├── scripts/
│   ├── find_wall.py          # Service server that turns toward and approaches the nearest wall
│   ├── wall_follower.py      # Node that follows the wall and triggers odometry recording
│   ├── record_odom_server.py # Action server that logs robot positions and distance traveled
│   └── odom_result_client.py # Action client that displays odometry data in real time
└── launch/wall_following.launch  # Launch file to start everything at once
```

## What Each Script Does

- **find\_wall.py** → Listens to the robot’s laser scan, figures out where the closest wall is, rotates toward it, moves forward until it’s close, then turns to align so the wall is on its right.
- **wall\_follower.py** → Calls `find_wall` first, then continuously reads the laser scan. If it’s too far from the wall, it turns toward it; if too close, it turns away; if just right, it moves straight. It also checks for obstacles ahead to handle corners.
- **record\_odom\_server.py** → Runs in the background, taking odometry readings once per second, calculating total distance traveled, and sending live feedback. Stops when the robot has done a full lap and returns the full path.
- **odom\_result\_client.py** → Connects to the odometry action server, starts recording, and prints:
  - Live total distance traveled.
  - Full list of recorded `(x, y, theta)` positions when done.

## How It All Works Together

1. **Gazebo simulation** publishes `/scan` (laser) and `/odom` (position) topics.
2. The `` file starts:
   - The wall-finding service.
   - The wall-following controller.
   - The odometry recorder.
3. The **wall follower** calls `find_wall` to get in position.
4. Before starting to move along the wall, it sends a goal to the odometry action server so recording starts right away.
5. While moving, the odometry server sends live distance updates to the client.
6. Once the robot returns near its starting point, the odometry server stops and sends the full recorded path.

## Demo Flow Suggestion

1. Start Gazebo world: `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch`
2. Start your package: `roslaunch ros_wall_following wall_following.launch`
3. In another terminal, run: `rosrun ros_wall_following odom_result_client.py`
4. Watch:
   - Robot finds and follows the wall.
   - Terminal shows live distance traveled.
   - At the end, it prints the whole route in coordinates.

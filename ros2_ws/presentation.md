逻辑大多没问题，参数设计不合理，因为需要考虑场地和机器人的尺寸，还有机器人的动力学参数也是考量因素。
并且我发现，根据这个课程里的gazebo环境和turtlebot机器人的尺寸，作业里设置的0.3米 0.2米并不合理，起码要0.8米，才不会一直撞墙。

 








ROS2

split project into two parts: one for service interface which is compiled using cmake, the other is main package compiled using python, because conflict between Python and CMake builds. Let's split this into two packages:
wall_follower_interfaces for the ROS2 interfaces (using CMake)
wall_follower for the Python nodes

Modify the setup.py File to Execute Your Python File: entry point…
Modify setup.py to find the .launch.py files : data_files..

node is designed to handle a specific function or capability of the robot, eg. One node for controlling wheel motors, One node for managing a laser rangefinder, One node for face recognition… a 'entry point' can start one or more nodes.

using the MultiThreadedExecutor for better callback handling


Making velocity proportional to how far it needs to turn
Providing smoother transitions
Ensuring it doesn't **overshoot** as much
Stopping more precisely at the target angle


There are a few potential issues I can see:
The laser data filtering only checks for distances > 0.1, but doesn't handle 'inf' or 'nan' values that might come from the laser scanner.
The angular error calculation assumes the laser scan covers 360 degrees uniformly, but this might not be true - we should check the scan angle range.
The proportional gain (0.3) might be too low, causing slow response, or too high, causing oscillations.

so i make all three adjustments: Add better laser data validation and filtering, adjust the angle calculations based on actual laser scan parameters, Tune the control parameters


Better Wall Following Logic:

Uses PD (Proportional-Derivative) control for smoother wall following
Adds lookahead using diagonal measurements to anticipate turns
Adjusts speed dynamically based on wall proximity
Focuses on maintaining consistent right-side distance to the wall
Diagnostic Information:

Prints laser configuration and key readings every 2 seconds
Shows important control parameters (error, P-term, D-term)
Includes velocity commands in the output
Improved Error Handling:

Properly handles invalid laser readings
Uses try-except blocks to prevent crashes
Provides clear error messages
Smoother Motion:

Reduced maximum angular velocity for smoother movement
Applies gentler corrections when near the target distance
Uses derivative control to prevent oscillations

If you’d like, I can also prepare a **demo narration script** where you can explain line-by-line what’s happening while showing the code during your presentation. That would make your audience follow along more easily.

Here’s a simple, conversational breakdown of the project so you can confidently demo it.

---

## Project Overview

We built a ROS package that makes a simulated robot:

1. **Find the nearest wall**.
2. **Follow that wall** while keeping a fixed distance.
3. **Record its odometry** (where it’s been and how far it’s traveled).

Everything runs in a Gazebo simulation with a TurtleBot3.

---

## Folder Structure (colloquial version)

```
ros_wall_following/
├── srv/FindWall.srv          # A custom service to trigger the 'find wall' behavior
├── action/OdomRecord.action  # A custom action to record odometry data over time
├── scripts/
│   ├── find_wall.py          # Service server that turns toward and approaches the nearest wall
│   ├── wall_follower.py      # Node that follows the wall and triggers odometry recording
│   ├── record_odom_server.py # Action server that logs robot positions and distance traveled
│   └── odom_result_client.py # Action client that displays odometry data in real time
└── launch/wall_following.launch  # Launch file to start everything at once
```

---

## What Each Script Does

- **find\_wall.py** → Listens to the robot’s laser scan, figures out where the closest wall is, rotates toward it, moves forward until it’s close, then turns to align so the wall is on its right.
- **wall\_follower.py** → Calls `find_wall` first, then continuously reads the laser scan. If it’s too far from the wall, it turns toward it; if too close, it turns away; if just right, it moves straight. It also checks for obstacles ahead to handle corners.
- **record\_odom\_server.py** → Runs in the background, taking odometry readings once per second, calculating total distance traveled, and sending live feedback. Stops when the robot has done a full lap and returns the full path.
- **odom\_result\_client.py** → Connects to the odometry action server, starts recording, and prints:
  - Live total distance traveled.
  - Full list of recorded `(x, y, theta)` positions when done.

---

## How It All Works Together

1. **Gazebo simulation** publishes `/scan` (laser) and `/odom` (position) topics.
2. The `` file starts:
   - The wall-finding service.
   - The wall-following controller.
   - The odometry recorder.
3. The **wall follower** calls `find_wall` to get in position.
4. Before starting to move along the wall, it sends a goal to the odometry action server so recording starts right away.
5. While moving, the odometry server sends live distance updates to the client.
6. Once the robot returns near its starting point, the odometry server stops and sends the full recorded path.

---

## Demo Flow Suggestion

1. Start Gazebo world: `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch`
2. Start your package: `roslaunch ros_wall_following wall_following.launch`
3. In another terminal, run: `rosrun ros_wall_following odom_result_client.py`
4. Watch:
   - Robot finds and follows the wall.
   - Terminal shows live distance traveled.
   - At the end, it prints the whole route in coordinates.

Next Steps for Real Gazebo Integration
To get the system working with a real TurtleBot3 in Gazebo, you would need to:

Fix Gazebo Issues:

Determine why Gazebo is crashing on startup (possibly due to hardware requirements or conflicting processes)
Make sure the correct environment variables are set for TurtleBot3
Test with Real Sensors:

The real wall_finder.py needs to process actual LiDAR data from the /scan topic
Ensure the robot can correctly identify and approach walls
Parameter Tuning:

Adjust control parameters in the wall following algorithm for smooth navigation
Tune wall detection thresholds based on the LiDAR characteristics
Fix Package Indexing:

Research why ROS 2 can't find the wall_follower package even though it's properly built and installed
This may involve checking the ROS 2 workspace setup or ament indexing system
The mock testing environment you now have provides a solid foundation for developing and debugging the control logic before moving to the real robot simulation.

Created distinct states for different behaviors (FINDING_WALL, FOLLOWING_WALL, TURNING_CORNER)
This allows the robot to adapt its control strategy based on its current situation

Results in smoother corrections and less oscillation when following walls
Corner Detection:

Added logic to detect corners by analyzing patterns in laser readings

Improves overall stability and safety
Laser Data Processing:

Safety Features:

Added emergency stop behavior when obstacles get too close
Prevents collisions even in unexpected situations
Configurable Parameters:

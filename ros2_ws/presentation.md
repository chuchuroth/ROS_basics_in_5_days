split project into two parts: one for service interface which is compiled using cmake, the other is main package compiled using python, because conflict between Python and CMake builds. Let's split this into two packages:
wall_follower_interfaces for the ROS2 interfaces (using CMake)
wall_follower for the Python nodes

Modify the setup.py File to Execute Your Python File: entry point…
Modify setup.py to find the .launch.py files : data_files..

node is designed to handle a specific function or capability of the robot, eg. One node for controlling wheel motors, One node for managing a laser rangefinder, One node for face recognition… a 'entry point' can start one or more nodes.

using the MultiThreadedExecutor for better callback handling


Making velocity proportional to how far it needs to turn
Providing smoother transitions
Ensuring it doesn't **overshoot** as much
Stopping more precisely at the target angle


There are a few potential issues I can see:
The laser data filtering only checks for distances > 0.1, but doesn't handle 'inf' or 'nan' values that might come from the laser scanner.
The angular error calculation assumes the laser scan covers 360 degrees uniformly, but this might not be true - we should check the scan angle range.
The proportional gain (0.3) might be too low, causing slow response, or too high, causing oscillations.

so i make all three adjustments: Add better laser data validation and filtering, adjust the angle calculations based on actual laser scan parameters, Tune the control parameters


Better Wall Following Logic:

Uses PD (Proportional-Derivative) control for smoother wall following
Adds lookahead using diagonal measurements to anticipate turns
Adjusts speed dynamically based on wall proximity
Focuses on maintaining consistent right-side distance to the wall
Diagnostic Information:

Prints laser configuration and key readings every 2 seconds
Shows important control parameters (error, P-term, D-term)
Includes velocity commands in the output
Improved Error Handling:

Properly handles invalid laser readings
Uses try-except blocks to prevent crashes
Provides clear error messages
Smoother Motion:

Reduced maximum angular velocity for smoother movement
Applies gentler corrections when near the target distance
Uses derivative control to prevent oscillations

Next Steps for Real Gazebo Integration
To get the system working with a real TurtleBot3 in Gazebo, you would need to:

+ Fix Gazebo Issues:

Determine why Gazebo is crashing on startup (possibly due to hardware requirements or conflicting processes)
Make sure the correct environment variables are set for TurtleBot3

+ Test with Real Sensors:

The real wall_finder.py needs to process actual LiDAR data from the /scan topic
Ensure the robot can correctly identify and approach walls

+ Parameter Tuning:

Adjust control parameters in the wall following algorithm for smooth navigation
Tune wall detection thresholds based on the LiDAR characteristics

+ Fix Package Indexing:

Research why ROS 2 can't find the wall_follower package even though it's properly built and installed
This may involve checking the ROS 2 workspace setup or ament indexing system
The mock testing environment you now have provides a solid foundation for developing and debugging the control logic before moving to the real robot simulation.

Created distinct states for different behaviors (FINDING_WALL, FOLLOWING_WALL, TURNING_CORNER)
This allows the robot to adapt its control strategy based on its current situation
PD (Proportional-Derivative) Controller:

Improved control over the robot's movement by considering both the current error and the rate of change
Results in smoother corrections and less oscillation when following walls
Corner Detection:

Added logic to detect corners by analyzing patterns in laser readings
Allows the robot to handle right turns when there's an opening and left turns when obstacles block the path
Dynamic Speed Adjustment:

Reduces speed automatically when turning sharply
Maintains higher speeds when moving straight along walls
Improves overall stability and safety
Laser Data Processing:

More sophisticated processing of laser scan data
Filters out invalid readings and considers multiple regions around the robot
Provides better situational awareness for navigation
Safety Features:

Added emergency stop behavior when obstacles get too close
Prevents collisions even in unexpected situations
Configurable Parameters:

Made control parameters accessible via ROS 2 parameters
Allows tuning without code modifications
Supports command-line parameter passing through launch files
Enhanced Launch Files:

Created comprehensive launch files with parameter configuration
Supports both simulation and real-robot scenarios

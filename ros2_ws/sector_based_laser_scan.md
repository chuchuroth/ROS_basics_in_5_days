## Summary

I have successfully applied the sector-based laser scan analysis method to the ROS1 wall finder node while maintaining ROS1 syntax and structural rules. Here are the key changes:

### **Major Improvements:**

1. **Added Sector-Based Analysis**: Implemented the same 12-sector analysis method from the example file, adapted for ROS1 syntax
2. **Enhanced Wall Detection**: Replaced simple index-based wall finding with intelligent sector-based obstacle detection
3. **Improved Logging**: Added detailed analysis output showing which sector contains the nearest wall
4. **ROS1 Compliance**: Maintained proper ROS1 syntax (no f-strings, rospy logging, etc.)

### **Key Features Added:**

- **`analyze_sectors_for_wall_finding()`**: Core sector analysis method
- **12 Defined Sectors**: From Right (0째-4.75째) to Far_Left (140.25째-179.75째)
- **Intelligent Rotation**: Based on sector analysis rather than simple laser index comparison
- **Detailed Feedback**: Shows closest sector, distance, angle, and rotation needed

### **ROS1 Syntax Maintained:**
- Used `%` formatting instead of f-strings
- Maintained `rospy.loginfo()` logging format
- Kept original service interface compatibility
- Ensured Python 2/3 compatibility

### **Benefits:**
- **More Accurate**: Finds the true nearest wall using sector analysis
- **More Robust**: Handles noisy laser data better
- **Better Debugging**: Provides clear information about which sector contains obstacles
- **Consistent**: Uses the same proven method as the ROS2 implementation

The ROS1 node now provides the same sophisticated wall-finding capabilities as the ROS2 version while maintaining full ROS1 compatibility and syntax requirements.

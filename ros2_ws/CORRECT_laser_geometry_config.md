I'll analyze both files to identify the issues with laser data interpretation and robot behavior. Let me start by examining the files. Now let me check the specific laser scan processing logic: Let me check the sector analysis method: Let me examine the sector analysis function: Now let me check the wall following file: Let me check the wall following laser interpretation logic: Now let me check the exact right wall distance calculation: Now I can see the critical issues! Let me analyze your robot's laser data to understand the problem:

## **🚨 CRITICAL LASER DATA INTERPRETATION ERRORS FOUND! 🚨**

Based on your laser scan message:
```
angle_min: -3.1241390705108643  # ≈ -179°
angle_max: 3.1415927410125732   # ≈ +180° 
angle_increment: 0.008714509196579456  # ≈ 0.5°
```

Your robot has **360° full-circle laser coverage**, but both your files are **completely wrong** about the laser configuration!

## **❌ What's Wrong:**

### **1. Incorrect Laser Configuration Assumption**
**Files assume:** 180° forward-only laser (0° to 180°)
**Reality:** 360° full-circle laser (-179° to +180°)

### **2. Wrong Index Mapping**
**Files assume:**
- Index 0 = 0° (right)
- Index 360 = 90° (front) 
- Index 719 = 180° (left)

**Reality with your laser:**
- Total points ≈ 720 (360° ÷ 0.5° per point)
- Index 0 = -179° (rear-left)
- Index 180 ≈ -90° (left side)
- Index 360 ≈ 0° (front)
- Index 540 ≈ +90° (right side)
- Index 719 ≈ +179° (rear-right)

### **3. Right Wall Detection is Completely Wrong**
**Wall following code:**
```python
# Right wall is at index 0 (0°)
right_idx = 0  # ❌ This is actually REAR-LEFT, not right!
```

**Should be:**
```python
# Calculate right side index correctly
right_idx = int((90.0 * math.pi/180.0 - self.angle_min) / self.angle_increment)
```

### **4. Front Detection is Wrong**
**Files assume:**
```python
front_idx = 360  # ❌ Wrong for your laser
```

**Should be:**
```python
front_idx = int((0.0 - self.angle_min) / self.angle_increment)  # ≈ index 360
```

## **🔧 Root Cause Analysis:**

### **Wall Following Issues:**
1. **Robot not following right wall** → It's reading rear-left distance instead of right-side distance
2. **Weird navigation behavior** → All directional calculations are wrong

### **Wall Finder Issues:**
1. **Stops at large distance** → Sector definitions are completely misaligned with actual laser geometry
2. **Timeout issues** → Robot is looking for walls in wrong directions

## **📊 Your Laser Geometry (Correct):**
```
        Front (0°, ~index 360)
             ↑
Left (-90°) ← R → Right (+90°, ~index 540)  
             ↓
        Rear (±180°, index 0/719)
```

## **🛠️ Fix Required:**
I need to completely rewrite the laser index calculations using your actual laser parameters:
- `angle_min = -3.124` (≈ -179°)
- `angle_increment = 0.008714` (≈ 0.5°)

This explains why your simple 3-line method works - you calculated the right-side index correctly using the actual laser parameters!

Would you like me to fix both files with the correct laser geometry calculations?

I see the issue! Looking at the output, your robot's laser configuration is different from what we assumed. The laser has these characteristics:

- **Angle Min**: -179.00°
- **Angle Max**: 180.00°  
- **720 points total**
- **Angular Resolution**: 0.499°

But the index mapping is wrong. Looking at the output:
- Right: Index 0 → 181.0° (should be around 0°)
- Front: Index 179 → 270.4° (should be around 90°)
- Left: Index 359 → 0.3° (should be around 180°)
- Back: Index 539 → 90.1° (should be around 270°)

The problem is that your robot's laser starts at -179° (not 0°), so the index calculation is off. Let me fix this by using the actual laser configuration:

Now I need to apply the same fix to the wall following file: 
```

Perfect! Now the laser index calculation is based on your robot's actual configuration:

- **Angle Min**: -179° (where the scan starts)
- **Angle Max**: 180° (where the scan ends) 
- **720 points** with ~0.499° resolution

The new mapping will correctly calculate:
- **Right (0°)**: Should be around index 358 
- **Front (90°)**: Should be around index 538
- **Left (180°)**: Should be around index 717
- **Back (-90°/270°)**: Should be around index 178

This uses the actual laser parameters (`angle_min`, `angle_increment`) to convert angles to indices, which is much more accurate than assuming a fixed mapping.

Try running the wall finder service again - it should now correctly identify the directions and find the wall!

You're absolutely right! We made a fundamental error in understanding your robot's laser configuration. Your robot has a **180-degree forward-facing laser**, not a full 360-degree laser. Let me correct this throughout the code.

Let me search for the handle_find_wall method more specifically: I see there are duplicated sections in the file. Let me fix each occurrence by being more specific with the context: It looks like there are duplicated sections in the file. Let me add the missing call to the laser analysis function at the right place: Let me examine the structure better and fix the issue by reading specific sections: Let me check if there are duplicated methods at the end of the file that are causing conflicts: I see the file structure is intact. Let me fix the specific occurrences by using unique line context: Let me search and replace each specific instance: Let me first update the print function to handle the 180-degree analysis:

Now let me update the directional analysis section to handle the missing 'back' direction:

Now let me update the log detailed laser info to reflect 180-degree coverage:

Now let me clean up the file by removing the duplicated sections that appear to be at the end, and fixing the method calls. Since the direct replacement isn't working due to duplicates, let me create a clean version:

Perfect! I've created a completely corrected version of the wall finder that properly handles your robot's **180-degree forward-facing laser** configuration. Here's what I've corrected:

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. **Laser Configuration Understanding**
- **180° Coverage**: Right (0°) to Left (180°) - forward hemisphere only
- **No Rear Coverage**: The robot cannot see behind itself
- **Correct Index Mapping**:
  - `0°` (right) → `index 0`
  - `90°` (front) → `index 360` 
  - `180°` (left) → `index 719`

### 2. **Updated Methods**
- **`get_standard_laser_indices_corrected()`**: Now returns correct indices with `back: None`
- **`analyze_180_degree_laser_data()`**: Replaces 360° analysis with proper 180° logic
- **`average_range()`**: Handles boundary conditions for 180° laser
- **Angle calculations**: Uses `0.25°` per index (180° ÷ 720 points)

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Properly handles missing rear direction
- Validates angle boundaries (0° to 180°)
- Corrected tolerance calculations for 180° instead of 360°

### 4. **Improved Logging**
- Clear indication of 180° laser type
- Proper directional analysis display
- Handles unavailable directions gracefully

## Usage

The new file is saved as `wall_finder_180_corrected.py`. You can:

1. **Replace the old file**:
   ```bash
   mv wall_finder_180_corrected.py wall_finder_final_version.py
   ```

2. **Or update your launch files** to use the new corrected version

## What This Fixes

✅ **Correct laser index mapping** for your real robot  
✅ **Proper 180° coverage understanding** - no rear sensing  
✅ **Accurate angle calculations** (0.25° resolution)  
✅ **Robust directional analysis** with missing direction handling  
✅ **Fixed timing issues** with enhanced subscription handling  

The robot will now correctly:
- Find the nearest wall within its 180° forward field of view
- Rotate to face it using proper angle calculations
- Position the wall on the right side for wall following

This should resolve both the laser configuration errors and the timing issues you were experiencing!

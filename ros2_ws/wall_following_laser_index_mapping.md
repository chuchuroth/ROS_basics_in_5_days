I can see the issue! Looking at the code, there's a fundamental error in the laser interpretation. The code is using an incorrect mapping that doesn't match your robot's actual 180-degree forward-facing laser configuration.

Let me check the current laser interpretation and fix it: The problem is that the code is using two different laser mapping functions and the wrong one for the control logic! Let me examine both functions: Now let me check which function is being used in the control logic: Found the problem! The issue is that:

1. **The control logic uses `get_standard_laser_indices()`** which has WRONG mappings
2. **But your robot actually has a 180-degree forward-facing laser** with the correct mapping you gave me earlier:
   - 0Â° (right): index 0
   - 90Â° (front): index 360  
   - 180Â° (left): index 719

The incorrect `get_standard_laser_indices()` function is mapping:
- `'right': int(self.num_ranges * 0.75)` = index 540 (which is actually pointing LEFT in your robot!)
- `'front': 0` (which is actually pointing RIGHT in your robot!)

This explains why the robot follows the LEFT wall instead of the RIGHT wall!

Let me fix this by updating the control logic to use the corrected laser indices: 
```


Made changes.


```
But wait! I just realized there's another issue. Based on our previous conversation, your robot has a **180-degree forward-facing laser**, but the `get_standard_laser_indices_corrected()` function assumes angles from -179Â° to 180Â°, which would be a 360-degree laser.

Let me check what the actual laser parameters are and fix the corrected function to match your robot's 180-degree forward-facing configuration: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me also update the comment in the laser callback to reflect the correct 180-degree laser interpretation: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me also update the detailed logging function to use the corrected indices: 
```


Made changes.


```
Perfect! Now let me also remove the incorrect `get_standard_laser_indices()` function since it's causing confusion and has wrong mappings: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let me also update the file header comment to reflect the correct laser interpretation: 
```


Made changes.

## Summary of Critical Fixes Made to wall_following_final_version.py:

### ðŸ”§ **Root Cause Identified:**
The robot was following the LEFT wall instead of the RIGHT wall because:

1. **Wrong laser mapping function**: The control logic was using `get_standard_laser_indices()` which had completely incorrect mappings
2. **Incorrect 'right' index**: The old function mapped `'right'` to `index 540` which actually points to the LEFT side in your 180Â° laser!
3. **Wrong laser assumption**: The code assumed a 360Â° laser but your robot has a 180Â° forward-facing laser

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Corrections Made:**

1. **Fixed Control Logic**: Changed `get_control_distances()` to use `get_standard_laser_indices_corrected()`

2. **Corrected 180Â° Laser Mapping**: Updated the corrected function to use your actual robot configuration:
   - **Right (0Â°)**: index 0 âœ…
   - **Front (90Â°)**: index 360 âœ…  
   - **Left (180Â°)**: index 719 âœ…
   - **Back**: None (no rear coverage) âœ…

3. **Fixed Front-Right Diagonal**: For 180Â° laser, front-right is at 45Â° (index ~180), not 315Â°

4. **Removed Incorrect Function**: Deleted the wrong `get_standard_laser_indices()` that was causing confusion

5. **Updated Comments**: Fixed all laser interpretation comments to reflect 180Â° forward-facing configuration

### ðŸš€ **Expected Behavior Now:**
- âœ… Robot will follow the wall on its **RIGHT-hand side** 
- âœ… Correct laser rays: right=0, front=360, left=719
- âœ… Proper wall distance control using the actual right-side laser readings
- âœ… Accurate obstacle detection using the actual front laser readings

The robot should now behave correctly and follow the right-side wall as intended! The laser interpretation now matches your robot's actual 180-degree forward-facing laser configuration with the correct index mapping you confirmed.

I'll analyze the obstacle detection logic in the wall following file and fix the sensitivity issue. Let me first examine the current obstacle detection implementation: Now let me check the control logic that uses these detections: I can see the issue! The current obstacle detection is too sensitive because:

1. **Front_Right sector is too wide**: It covers 20° to 70° which includes side areas
2. **Front_Center sector is too wide**: 0° ± 20° (40° total) is quite wide
3. **It's checking both Front_Center AND Front_Right**, making it even more sensitive
4. **The threshold is 0.5m but applied to very wide sectors**

Let me fix this by:
1. Narrowing the Front_Center sector to only ±10° (20° total)
2. Removing the Front_Right check from obstacle avoidance
3. Adding a closer threshold for the narrow front sector
4. Adding some logic to prevent false positives from the wall itself 
```


Made changes.

Now let me update the control logic to be less sensitive and only check the narrow front center: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me also add a more robust front distance check to prevent issues. Let me update the `get_front_distance()` method to use a narrower window and add some additional logic:

Made changes.

Let me also update the comment in the laser callback to reflect that it's now correctly handling 360° laser: 
```


Made changes.

Perfect! I've fixed the obstacle detection sensitivity issues in your wall following file. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Key Improvements Made:

### 1. **Narrowed Front Detection Sector**
- **Before**: `Front_Center` was ±20° (40° total width)
- **After**: `Front_Center` is ±10° (20° total width)
- **Result**: Only detects obstacles directly in front, not side obstacles

### 2. **Removed Side Area False Positives**
- **Before**: Checked both `Front_Center` AND `Front_Right` (20°-70°)
- **After**: Only checks `Front_Center` (±10°)
- **Result**: No more false positives from side roads or wall edges

### 3. **Closer Detection Threshold**
- **Before**: Used `self.front_obstacle_threshold` (0.5m) for wide sectors
- **After**: Uses `close_threshold = 0.3m` for narrow front sector only
- **Result**: Only reacts to immediate front obstacles, not distant ones

### 4. **More Precise Front Distance Calculation**
- **Before**: Averaged over ±2.5° window (window=5)
- **After**: Averaged over ±1° window (window=2)  
- **Result**: More precise front distance measurement

### 5. **Improved Control Logic**
- **Before**: `if detections.get("Front_Center", False) or detections.get("Front_Right", False):`
- **After**: `if detections.get("Front_Center", False):` with closer threshold
- **Result**: Much less sensitive, only reacts to real front obstacles

## Expected Behavior Changes:

✅ **Reduced False Positives**: No more constant "Front obstacle detected" messages from:
- Side road openings
- Distant obstacles (>0.3m)
- Wall edges in side areas
- Objects in peripheral vision

✅ **More Focused Detection**: Only reacts to obstacles that are:
- Directly in front (±10° from robot's heading)
- Very close (<0.3m away)
- Actually blocking the robot's path

✅ **Better Wall Following**: Robot will:
- Follow walls more smoothly
- Not get confused by side openings
- Only avoid real front obstacles
- Focus on maintaining right wall distance

The robot should now behave much more naturally and stop the excessive "turning left" behavior you were experiencing!

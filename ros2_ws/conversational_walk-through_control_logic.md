Here’s a clear, conversational walk-through of those two core files so you can explain them in your demo — focusing on structure, why each part exists, and what the variables/attributes are doing.

---

## **1. `find_wall.py`**



**Structure & flow:**

* **`class FindWallServer`**:
  Holds everything — ROS node setup, subscribers, publisher, and the service callback.

* **`__init__` method**:

  * `rospy.init_node('find_wall_server')` → registers the node.
  * `self.scan = None` → will store the latest LaserScan message.
  * Subscriber to `/scan` → calls `scan_callback` each time laser data arrives, storing it in `self.scan`.
  * Publisher to `/cmd_vel` → sends velocity commands to the robot.
  * Creates the service `/find_wall` → links to `handle_find_wall`.
  * `rospy.spin()` → keeps the node alive.

* **`scan_callback`**:
  Simple — just saves incoming laser scan messages in `self.scan` so the rest of the code can use them.

* **`handle_find_wall`**:

  1. **Wait for scan data** — so we don’t move with empty sensor readings.
  2. **Step 1: Turn toward the nearest wall**

     * Looks through `self.scan.ranges` to find the smallest distance (closest object).
     * Calculates if that closest beam is directly ahead; if not, rotates toward it by setting `twist.angular.z`.
  3. **Step 2: Move forward until \~0.3m away**

     * Drives straight (`twist.linear.x = 0.2`) until the front beam is ≤ 0.3 m.
  4. **Step 3: Align so wall is on right side**

     * Rotates until beam index 270 points at the wall.
  5. **Return `FindWallResponse(wallfound=True)`** — signals to the caller that we’re done.

**Key variables:**

* `self.scan` → latest LaserScan data (distance readings in meters).
* `front_idx` → index in `ranges` array for the straight-ahead laser beam.
* `target_idx = 270` → index representing the beam to the robot’s right side.
* `twist` → a `geometry_msgs/Twist` message for setting linear & angular velocity.

## **2. `wall_follower.py`** 



**Structure & flow:**

* **`class WallFollower`**:
  Contains the node’s setup, laser subscription, and main control logic.

* **`__init__` method**:

  1. Starts the ROS node with `rospy.init_node('wall_follower')`.
  2. **Waits for and calls `find_wall` service** — ensures we start in the right position.
  3. **Connects to odometry recording action server** (`record_odom`) — sends an empty goal to start recording before we move.
  4. Sets up:

     * Subscriber to `/scan` → triggers `scan_callback`.
     * Publisher to `/cmd_vel` → sends movement commands.
  5. Calls `rospy.spin()` to keep running.

* **`scan_callback`**:

  * Stores the latest LaserScan in `self.scan`.
  * Calls `follow_wall()` every time new scan data arrives.

* **`follow_wall`**:

  1. Picks out the **right-side laser beam** (`right_idx`) which is 90° to the right from the front.
  2. Reads `distance` to the wall on the right.
  3. Applies simple **distance control**:

     * If `distance > 0.3 m` → too far → turn right (`angular.z = -0.3`).
     * If `distance < 0.2 m` → too close → turn left (`angular.z = 0.3`).
     * Else → go straight.
  4. Adds **corner handling**:

     * If front distance < 0.5 m → turn left quickly while moving forward.
  5. Publishes the `twist` command.

**Key variables:**

* `self.scan` → latest LaserScan.
* `mid` → index of the front-facing beam in the scan array.
* `right_idx` → index of the beam 90° to the right.
* `distance` → distance from right wall.
* `twist` → velocity command to send to `/cmd_vel`.

## **Why it’s structured this way**

* **Classes** keep related data (like `self.scan`) and methods together, so callbacks and movement logic can share state easily.
* **Callbacks** (`scan_callback`) react to new sensor data instantly — essential for real-time control.
* **Service** (`handle_find_wall`) handles a one-time “setup” action before continuous driving.
* **Action client** in `wall_follower` ensures odometry logging starts **before** movement begins.
* **Variables** like `front_idx` and `right_idx` turn raw laser readings into meaningful control inputs (front obstacle detection, right wall distance).

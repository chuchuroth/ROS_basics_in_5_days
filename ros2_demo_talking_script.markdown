# ROS2 Demo Talking Script

Today, I am going to present a ROS2 program demo, which is an assignment from the course *ROS2 Basics in 5 Days* from Construct. I’ll explain some very basic ROS2 operations and concepts like ROS nodes, topics, services, and actions—the communication mechanisms defined in ROS2. Essentially, I’ll cover what I’ve learned in this course. I’ll also discuss tools like `rqt`, `ros2 bag`, and the visualization tool `rviz2`.

## Launching the Program
First, let me launch the program. I’ll move the robot to a corner to avoid interference from a concrete wall. Let’s open `rviz2` to get a view of the robot and understand why it tends to recognize the concrete wall.

This program controls a TurtleBot robot to perform a wall-following movement. Here’s the process:
- The robot publishes to `/scan` (laser) and `/odom` (position) topics.
- The wall follower calls the `find_wall` service to get into position.
- Before starting to move along the wall, it sends a goal to the odometry action server to start recording immediately.
- While moving, the odometry server sends live distance updates to the client.
- Once the robot returns near its starting point, the odometry server stops and sends the full recorded path.

## Program Structure
Let’s get a glimpse of the structure. First, run `ros2 node list` to see the three main nodes in this program. Now, let’s get information about these nodes using `ros2 node info`. Here’s what each node does:

- **wall_finder.py**: This node is a ROS2 service server. When another node calls `find_wall`, it listens to the robot’s laser scan, figures out where the closest wall is, rotates toward it, moves forward until it’s close, then turns to align so the wall is on its right.
- **wall_following.py**: The main node that implements the wall-following behavior. It calls `find_wall` first, then continuously reads the laser scan. If it’s too far from the wall, it turns toward it; if too close, it turns away; if just right, it moves straight. It also checks for obstacles ahead to handle corners and starts the odometry recording action before driving.
- **odom_recorder.py**: An action server that logs robot positions and distance traveled, calculating total distance and sending feedback. It stops when the robot completes a full lap and returns the full path.

## Visualizing Node Connections
Let’s use `rqt_graph` to view the nodes and their topic connections graphically. This is super useful for investigating the structure of a ROS2 program. You can see the three nodes: `find_wall`, `wall_follower`, and `record_odom_server`. You can also see their relationships:
- The `wall_follower` node is the client that calls the `find_wall` service server and the `record_odom_server` action server.
- There are four topics highlighted in squares, showing which node is publishing and which is subscribing.
- The `record_odom` topic is published and subscribed to by both the `wall_follower` and `record_odom_server` nodes.
- The `cmd_vel` topic is published by both `find_wall` and `wall_follower` because they both send velocity commands to the robot.

## Exploring Topics
Now, let’s check the topics from the command line using `ros2 topic list` and `ros2 topic info`. These align with the `rqt_graph`. In ROS2, there are multiple ways to do things, and you can use different tools to get basic information.

## Interpreting Laser Scan Data
One critical task in this program is correctly interpreting the laser scan data. Run `ros2 topic echo /scan` to see the laser scan message structure. This method uses the sector-based approach adapted for 360° laser coverage, dividing the full laser scan into sectors for obstacle detection and wall finding with correct geometry calculations.   just like the task autonomous_exploration.py , which divides the 360° laser scan into 6 sectors The TurtleBot’s geometry parameters range from -180° to +180°, unlike the Gazebo simulator robot, which ranges from 0° to 360°. it's better to first clean the data and filter the invalid data out, and another way to improve the precision and stability is to Calculate average distance over a window of laser points, This reduces noise . .


## Recording and Replaying Data with ros2 bag
In ROS2, there’s no `rqt_console` or `rqt_plot`. Instead, it’s better to record a `ros2 bag` to work with data. Run `ros2 bag record -a` to record all topics, or `ros2 bag record /scan > scan.csv` to record a specific topic and export it to a CSV file for further analysis.

To investigate the bag, run `ros2 bag info` to see details like the date, file size, number of messages, topics, and message types. This is very useful in real-life applications, as you can store field testing data, recreate scenarios in a lab, and analyze what happened.

To replay the data, run `ros2 bag play`.

Some basic Linux commands for analyzing the CSV:
- `tail -n1 scan.csv` (last row)
- `cut -d',' -f1,2 odom.csv` (columns 1 and 2)
- `cut -d',' -f100 scan.csv` (specific column)

## Exploring Actions
In ROS2, use `ros2 action list` and `ros2 action info` to get action information. The `record_odom` topic comes from my custom action server, which logs robot positions and distance traveled.

To publish to a topic, first check the interface type using `ros2 interface list | grep wall` to see the custom interfaces. Then, run `ros2 interface show wall_follower_interfaces/action/OdomRecord` to get the structure of this action interface. The result is a structured list of odometry data, and the feedback is a float number representing the total distance. Odometry tracks the robot’s change in position relative to a starting point, represented by three values (x, y, θ), stored as an array.

To get the exact format for using the `OdomRecord` interface, run `ros2 interface proto wall_follower_interfaces/action/OdomRecord`. The `proto` command gives only the goal part, used when calling an action server. To get real-time values from this action message, run:
- `ros2 action send_goal /record_odom wall_follower_interfaces/action/OdomRecord "{}"`

This shows the total distance traveled so far.

A third way to call the action server is to create a separate action client node. In this program, the `wall_follower` client sends a goal to the `record_odom_server`, which responds and sends its status back. The `record_odom_server` is defined such that when the robot completes a full lap, it provides feedback with the total distance moved and returns the list of recorded odometries.

## Exploring Services
Next, let’s check the services using `ros2 service list`. We have the `find_wall` service. Run `ros2 service type /find_wall` to get the service type, which is required when calling the service. Then, run `ros2 service call /find_wall wall_follower_interfaces/srv/FindWall` to trigger it. In our program, this means the robot has found the wall, demonstrating a request-and-response mechanism.

To see how the service message is defined:
- Run `ros2 interface list | grep wall`
- Run `ros2 interface show wall_follower_interfaces/srv/FindWall`

The `FindWall.srv` is a custom service to trigger the "find wall" behavior. Another way to call the service is by creating a service client, which is included in the `wall_following` node.

## QoS Settings
In ROS2, the Quality of Service (QoS) settings of a topic must be compatible between the publisher and subscriber nodes, or communication won’t work. To get information about the QoS settings of a specific topic, run `ros2 topic info /scan -v`.
so i Use QoS settings that work well with real robot sensors, QoSProfile, ReliabilityPolicy, DurabilityPolicy

# ROS2 Wall Finder Service Node - Comprehensive Production Implementation

## Overview and Purpose
This ROS2 node provides a service-based wall finding capability that locates the nearest wall and positions the robot for optimal wall following behavior. The node implements a 3-step process:
1. ROTATION PHASE: Rotate to face the nearest wall (closest obstacle)
2. APPROACH PHASE: Move forward until reaching optimal distance (0.3m)
3. ALIGNMENT PHASE: Rotate until wall is positioned on right side

## Architectural Design Decisions
This implementation follows ROS2 best practices and incorporates several key architectural decisions for production-ready operation:

1. SERVICE-BASED ARCHITECTURE:
   - Implements FindWall service interface for external integration
   - Decouples wall finding from wall following for modularity
   - Enables reusable wall detection across different behaviors
   - Provides clear success/failure responses for client coordination

2. 360° LASER INTEGRATION:
   - Supports full 360° laser scanners (LIDAR) with correct geometry
   - Uses sector-based analysis for improved obstacle detection
   - Implements correct angle calculations for actual laser hardware
   - Handles laser coordinate transformations automatically

3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
   - Comprehensive timeout mechanisms for all phases
   - Graceful handling of sensor data interruptions
   - Detailed logging for production monitoring and debugging
   - Safe fallback behaviors when operations fail

4. ROS2-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Compatible QoS settings for real robot sensors
   - Proper lifecycle management with clean shutdown
   - Efficient callback-based sensor processing
   - Thread-safe operation with ROS2 executors

## Technical Specifications
- Laser Configuration: 360° coverage, ~720 points, angle_min≈-3.12, angle_max≈3.14
- Movement Parameters: Configurable rotation speed, approach speed, target distance
- Timeout Protection: All operations protected with reasonable timeouts
- Sector Analysis: Divides laser scan into 6 meaningful sectors for analysis
- Control Precision: Maintains optimal distance and alignment tolerances

## 360-Degree Laser Geometry
The implementation correctly handles 360° laser geometry with:
- angle_min ≈ -179° (rear-left starting point)
- angle_max ≈ +180° (rear-right ending point)  
- angle_increment ≈ 0.5° per reading (typical)
- Total points ≈ 720 (full circle coverage)

Key direction calculations:
- Front (0°): index = (0 - angle_min) / angle_increment
- Right (+90°): index = (π/2 - angle_min) / angle_increment
- Left (-90°): index = (-π/2 - angle_min) / angle_increment
- Rear (±180°): index = (π - angle_min) / angle_increment

## Sector-Based Analysis Method
This implementation uses an advanced sector-based laser analysis approach that divides the 360° laser scan into 6 meaningful sectors:
1. FRONT_NEAR (±30°): Immediate collision detection
2. FRONT_SIDE (±30-60°): Near-field obstacle awareness
3. LEFT/RIGHT (60-120°): Side wall detection and distance measurement
4. BACK_SIDE (120-150°): Rear obstacle awareness
5. BACK (150-180°): Rear collision detection

This method provides superior obstacle detection compared to single-point laser readings and enables more intelligent navigation decisions.

## Critical Laser Geometry Corrections
Previous implementations incorrectly assumed laser angle_min=0, leading to significant indexing errors. This implementation uses the CORRECT formula:
    target_index = (target_angle - angle_min) / angle_increment

This correction is essential for proper operation with real robot hardware where angle_min is typically around -3.12 radians.

## Integration with Ecosystem
This node is designed to work seamlessly with:
- ROS2 navigation stack (Nav2)
- Wall following control nodes
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Real robot hardware platforms (TurtleBot3, etc.)
- Custom robot configurations

## File Structure Rationale
The code is organized into logical sections that mirror the operational workflow:
1. ROS2 Node Initialization (communication setup)
2. Sensor Data Processing (perception pipeline)
3. Wall Detection Algorithms (analysis and decision making)
4. Movement Control Functions (action execution)
5. Service Handler (integration interface)
6. Utility Functions (supporting operations)

This structure maximizes code maintainability, enables easy debugging of specific operational phases, and facilitates future enhancements.

# ROS2 Wall Following Client Node - Comprehensive Production Implementation

## Overview and Purpose
This ROS2 node implements autonomous wall following behavior by coordinating multiple services and actions to achieve continuous wall tracking. The node acts as the main controller that:
1. Calls the find_wall service to locate and approach the nearest wall
2. Starts odometry recording action for path tracking and analysis
3. Executes continuous wall following using laser-guided proportional control
4. Maintains optimal distance from wall on robot's RIGHT side

## Architectural Design Decisions
This implementation follows a modern ROS2 architecture that provides several key advantages over traditional approaches:

   - Supports concurrent operation without blocking main control loop

3. CONTINUOUS REACTIVE CONTROL LOOP:
   - Implements real-time wall following within laser scan callback
   - Uses proportional control algorithm for smooth wall tracking
   - Maintains consistent performance at laser scan frequency (~10Hz)
   - Provides immediate response to environmental changes

4. ROS2-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:

## 360-Degree Laser Geometry Support
The implementation correctly handles 360° laser geometry with:
- angle_min ≈ -179° (rear-left starting point)
- angle_max ≈ +180° (rear-right ending point)  
- angle_increment ≈ 0.5° per reading (device dependent)
- Total points ≈ 720 (full circle coverage)

Critical direction calculations:
- Front (0°): index = (0 - angle_min) / angle_increment
- Right (+90°): index = (π/2 - angle_min) / angle_increment  
- Left (-90°): index = (-π/2 - angle_min) / angle_increment

## Wall Following Control Strategy
The node implements a proven proportional control strategy:
- Target Distance Range: 0.2m - 0.3m from right wall
- If distance > 0.3m: Turn right (angular.z = -0.4, move closer to wall)
- If distance < 0.2m: Turn left (angular.z = +0.4, move away from wall)
- If distance in range: Go straight (angular.z = 0.0, optimal tracking)
- Forward Motion: Constant linear.x = 0.1 m/s for steady progress

## Collision Avoidance Integration
Front obstacle detection with emergency response:
- Detection Threshold: Front distance < 0.5m triggers avoidance
- Avoidance Maneuver: Sharp left turn (angular.z = 3.0) with continued forward motion
- Override Behavior: Collision avoidance overrides distance control when active
- Recovery: Automatic return to wall following when path is clear

## Sector-Based Analysis Foundation
While this node uses simplified distance control, it is designed to be compatible with sector-based laser analysis for enhanced obstacle detection. The architecture supports easy upgrade to multi-sector analysis for more sophisticated navigation behaviors.

## Integration with Ecosystem
This node seamlessly integrates with:
- find_wall service (wall detection and initial positioning)
- record_odom action server (path tracking and analysis)
- ROS2 navigation stack (Nav2) for advanced behaviors
- Gazebo simulation environment for testing and validation

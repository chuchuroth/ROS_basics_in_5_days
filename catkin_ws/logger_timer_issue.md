Here’s a summary of the timing and callback-related settings in both files, and whether they are consistent and robust for service/action calls:

---

## wall_finder_final_version.py

- **Timeouts for robot actions:**
  - `self.rotation_timeout = 16.0` (used for rotation steps)
  - `self.approach_timeout = 10.0` (used for approach/move steps)
  - These are passed to `rotate_until_condition` and `move_until_close` as `timeout_sec`.

- **Spin and sleep intervals:**
  - All `rclpy.spin_once(self, timeout_sec=1)` and `time.sleep(0.5)` in loops.
  - Progress logs every 5 seconds.

- **No explicit service client calls** (this is a service server node).

---

## wall_following_final_version.py

- **Service client for /find_wall:**
  - Waits for service: `wait_for_service(timeout_sec=10.0)`
  - Calls service: `rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, future, timeout_sec=60.0)`
    - This means the client will wait up to 60 seconds for the `/find_wall` service to respond.
  - If no response in 60 seconds, logs an error and aborts.

- **Action client for /record_odom:**
  - Waits for server: `wait_for_server(timeout_sec=10.0)`
  - Sends goal: `rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, send_goal_future, timeout_sec=10.0)`
    - Waits up to 10 seconds for the action server to accept the goal.

- **Control loop logging:**
  - Detailed log every 5 seconds (now matches wall_finder).

---

## Callback/Timeout Consistency

- **Service/Action Callbacks:**  
  - The wall following node waits a full 60 seconds for `/find_wall` to respond, which is more than enough for the wall finder to complete its sequence, even with slow user-readable logging and sleeps.
  - The action client waits 10 seconds for the odom action server to accept the goal, which is also reasonable.

- **Robot Action Timeouts:**  
  - The wall finder’s rotation and approach timeouts (16s and 10s) are well within the 60s allowed by the wall following client.

- **Spin/Sleep Intervals:**  
  - All `spin_once` and `sleep` intervals are now consistent and human-friendly (0.5s or 1s sleeps, 5s log intervals).

---

## Conclusion

- **No timing or callback issues:** The wall following client will always wait long enough for the wall finder to finish, even with slow on-screen updates.
- **All intervals and timeouts are now consistent and robust.**
- **No further changes are needed for callback or timeout settings.**

If you want to further tune the timeouts (e.g., make the wall following client even more patient), you can increase the `timeout_sec` values in the service/action calls, but the current settings are already safe and user-friendly.

You are correct to suspect a timing issue. Here’s what’s likely happening:

- In simulation, when the wall following node calls the `/find_wall` service, it waits up to 60 seconds for a response (`rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, future, timeout_sec=60.0)`).
- The wall finder node, during "Step 3: Rotating to position wall on right side...", may still be running a long rotation or waiting for a condition, but if the service callback does not return a response within 60 seconds, the client times out and prints:
  - `"No response from /find_wall service (timeout)"`
  - `"Could not find wall - aborting preparation"`

**Possible causes:**
- The wall finder’s rotation or alignment logic (especially in Step 3) is taking longer than 60 seconds to complete, especially if the robot is slow or the tolerance is tight.
- If the robot gets stuck or the condition for alignment is never met, the service callback never returns, causing the client to time out.

**How to fix:**
1. **Increase the client timeout:**  
   In wall_following_final_version.py, increase the timeout in `rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(self, future, timeout_sec=60.0)` to a larger value (e.g., 120.0 or even 300.0 seconds) to give the wall finder more time to finish.

2. **Check wall finder’s Step 3 logic:**  
   - Make sure the alignment condition in Step 3 will always eventually be met (e.g., the robot is not stuck in an infinite loop).
   - Consider adding a maximum duration for Step 3 in the wall finder, and return a failure response if it cannot align in time.

3. **Add more logging:**  
   - In the wall finder, log the time spent in Step 3 and when the service callback is about to return.

**Summary:**  
Yes, this is a timing issue. The wall following client times out after 60 seconds if the wall finder service does not respond. If Step 3 in the wall finder takes too long, the client will abort. Increase the client timeout and/or ensure the wall finder’s Step 3 always completes in a reasonable time.

Would you like me to make these changes for you?
